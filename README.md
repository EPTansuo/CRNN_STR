# CRNN Scene Text Tecognition

Paper： 
[An End-to-End Trainable Neural Network for Image-based Sequence Recognition and Its Application to Scene Text Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05717)

## Dataset

 The Datasets generated by [trdg](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator)。

You just need to generate the training and test datasets into two different directories.

## Result

The amount of training data for all models is 10000.

| Five Words with Noise   | Single Word with Noise (trained with same Size 100x32) | Three Words with Background |

| ![](./img/5-words.png)  | ![](./img/1-word.png)                                  | ![](./img/3-words.png)      |
| Test Accuracy: 92.5%    | Test Accuracy: 93.5%                                   | Test Accuracy: 40.4%        |
| batch_size=16, epoch=30 | batch_size=32, epoch=30                                | batch_size=16, epoch=30     |

## Comment

`crnn_str_simple-ipynb` is a simple CRNN implementation that can be used with **a single word** dataset with good results.

`crnn_str.ipynb` can be used to identify text images of different lengths, and can also modify parameters to select **single channel** (grayscale image) or **three channel** (RGB color image)  for training and testing.

## Use pretrained model

The pretrained models can be downloaded by [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12qHk8XSFvcwkC8UKYrpkFznX2U0Q1drV?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DNJ46qsmVfj5bcLQEQLxSg?pwd=nw9x) .

The document description is as follows:
